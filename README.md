Safe Haven Savings Comparator
A professional financial calculator to compare the after-tax returns of Certificate of Deposit (CD) and Treasury Bill (T-Bill) investment strategies.

Overview
Safe Haven helps users make informed decisions by providing a side-by-side comparison of after-tax returns for a single CD versus a T-Bill reinvestment (ladder) strategy. The calculator uses projected 2025 federal tax brackets, state-specific tax settings, and an AGI-based calculation model to provide a precise and personalized analysis.

Data & Assumptions
Federal Tax Data: All calculations are based on the projected 2025 IRS tax brackets and standard deduction amounts.

State Tax Data: The calculator includes simplified progressive tax brackets for several major states. It does not account for all state-specific nuances, deductions, or credits.

Interest Rates: The CD and T-Bill rates are pre-loaded based on data from mid-August 2025. These are static values used for consistent calculations.

T-Bill Reinvestment: The model assumes the user reinvests the entire proceeds (principal + interest) from each T-Bill at maturity into a new T-Bill of the same duration.
