AGI - Standard Deduction = Taxable Income
Taxable Income → Marginal Tax Rates (Federal + State)
```

### After-Tax Returns
```
Gross Interest - Federal Tax - State Tax = After-Tax Return
State Tax = $0 for T-Bills (exempt in all states)
```

### Duration Matching
- **3-month CD** ↔ 13-week T-Bill (1x)
- **6-month CD** ↔ 26-week T-Bill (1x) or 13-week ladder (2x)
